# 8-Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my solutions for the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/).  This challenge consists of 8 real-world business case studies designed to sharpen SQL and data analysis skills through practical, hands-on problem-solving.

Each case study focuses on a different domain such as food, finance, digital marketing, transportation, and more. The data is modeled to mimic realistic business scenarios, and the questions are geared toward helping analysts extract meaningful insights.

## Skills Practiced

- Complex joins and multi-table queries
- Aggregation, filtering, and date manipulation
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Subqueries
- Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`
- Data transformation and customer segmentation
- Translating business problems into SQL queries

## What I Learned

Working through these 8 real-world case studies helped me strengthen my SQL skills significantly. Some of the key takeaways:

* **Advanced Joins & Filtering**: Mastered combining multiple tables using `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, and conditional filters for dynamic reporting.
* **Window Functions**: Applied `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` to derive first purchases, popularity rankings, and temporal behaviors.
* **CTEs & Subqueries**: Used Common Table Expressions for breaking down complex logic into manageable steps.
* **Data Transformation**: Learned to flag and segment customers based on behavior (e.g., pre- and post-membership) using `CASE` statements and date comparisons.
* **Business Thinking**: Practiced interpreting raw data to answer real business questions involving customer loyalty, product trends, and performance.

These projects not only sharpened my SQL but also taught me to think like an analyst—translating questions into logic, and logic into insight.
